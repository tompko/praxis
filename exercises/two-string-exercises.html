<p>These two problems seem to be on every list of programming interview questions:</p>
<p>1) Remove all duplicate characters from a string. Thus, &#8220;aaabbb&#8221; becomes &#8220;ab&#8221; and &#8220;abcbd&#8221; becomes &#8220;abcd&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) Replace all runs of consecutive spaces with a single space. Thus, &#8220;a.b&#8221; is unchanged and &#8220;a..b&#8221; becomes &#8220;a.b&#8221;, using a dot to make the space visible.</p>
<p>Your task is to write the two requested functions. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/09/02/two-string-exercises/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/3NjlYZ6s">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
