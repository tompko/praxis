<p>Pig Latin is an English-language word game, usually played by children, in which words are mutated systematically.  A word that begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) has the syllable &#8220;way&#8221; added to the end; for instance, art becomes art-way and eagle becomes eagle-way.  A word that begins with one or more consonants has the initial consonants stripped, moved to the end of the word, then the syllable &#8220;ay&#8221; is added; for instance, start becomes art-stay and door becomes oor-day.  A hyphen is added as shown above as an aid to prevent ambiguity; otherwise, a word like aspray could be the translation of spray (ay-spray) or prays (ays-pray).  Even so, some words remain ambiguous; art-way could be translated as either art or wart.</p>
<p>Your task is to write functions that translate English to Pig Latin and Pig Latin to English.  When you are finished, you may <a href="/2009/06/02/pig-latin/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/hRfVoxCA">run</a> a suggested solution, or post your solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
