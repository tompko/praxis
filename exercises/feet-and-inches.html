<div class="entrybody">
<p>Drawing programs measure distances in ten-thousandths of an inch, like 73.0185, but carpenters work in feet, inches, and thirty-seconds of an inch, like 6 feet 1 and 1/32 inches.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that takes a measurement in decimal notation and returns the measurement in carpenter&#8217;s notation; readers unfamiliar with imperial measurements will want to know that there are twelve inches in a foot.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/07/01/feet-and-inches/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/XF5DR2Gc">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
