<p>A rational number, or fraction, is the ratio of two integers; for instance, 4/7 is the ratio of 4 (the numerator) divided by 7 (the denominator).  No rational number may have a denominator of zero.  Rational numbers respond to all the same operations as integers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and they may also be compared by the less-than operator.</p>
<p>Your task is to write functions that perform arithmetic on rational numbers.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/01/25/rational-numbers/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/EnDFmHgs">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
