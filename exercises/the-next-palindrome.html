<p>This exercise comes originally from the <a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/PALIN/">Sphere Online Judge</a>; I read it on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8lax4/next_palindrome_number/">Proggit</a> based on a blog <a href="http://worldfamos.blogspot.com/2009/05/next-palindrome-number.html">posting</a> by Chethan T.  So many of the answers were wrong that I decided it would make a good exercise for Programming Praxis.  Here is SPOJ&#8217;s statement of the exercise:</p>
<blockquote><p>A positive integer is called a palindrome if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer K of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than K to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to write a function that calculates the next palindrome larger than its input.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/05/22/the-next-palindrome/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/oHbzw5WF">run</a> a suggested solution, or post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
