<p>This question appears on several lists of interview questions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Write a function that takes an input string and returns the first character from the string that is not repeated later in the string. For instance, the two letters &#8220;d&#8221; and &#8220;f&#8221; in the input string &#8220;aabcbcdeef&#8221; are non-repeating, and the function should return &#8220;d&#8221; since &#8220;f&#8221; appears later in the string. The function should return some indication if there are no non-repeating characters in the string.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to write the indicated function. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/08/19/first-non-repeating-character/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/kWBmScj6">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
