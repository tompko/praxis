<p>The sequence of Hamming numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36, &hellip; (<a href="http://oeis.org/A051037">A051037</a>) consists of all numbers of the form 2<sup><em>i</em></sup>&middot;3<sup><em>j</em></sup>&middot;5<sup><em>k</em></sup> where <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> and <em>k</em> are non-negative integers. Edsger Dijkstra <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~cs410aph/Lectures/Smalltalk%20II/Dijkstra%20on%20Hamming's%20Problem.pdf">introduced this sequence to computer science</a> in his book <em>A Discipline of Programming</em>, and it has been a staple of beginning programming courses ever since. Dijkstra wrote a program based on three axioms:</p>
<blockquote><p>Axiom 1: The value 1 is in the sequence.</p>
<p>Axiom 2: If <em>x</em> is in the sequence, so are 2 * <em>x</em>, 3 * <em>x</em>, and 5 * <em>x</em>.</p>
<p>Axiom 3: The sequence contains no other values other than those that belong to it on account of Axioms 1 and 2.</p></blockquote>

<p>Your task is to write a program to compute the first thousand terms of the Hamming sequence. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/08/30/hamming-numbers/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/kzPfcVH7">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
