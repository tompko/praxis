<h2>Segmented Sieve Of&nbsp;Eratosthenes</h2>

<p>We examined the Sieve of Eratosthenes for computing prime numbers less than <em>n</em> in our second <a href="/2009/02/19/sieve-of-eratosthenes/">exercise</a> nearly a year ago.  In today&#8217;s exercise, we update that algorithm to compute the prime numbers in a range <em>L</em> to <em>R</em>, where the range doesn&#8217;t start at zero and is too large to fit in memory all at once.  Specifically, we discuss a function that takes parameters <em>L</em>, for the left end of the range, and <em>R</em>, for the right end of the range, and a parameter <em>B</em> that divides <em>R</em> &#8211; <em>L</em>; we also assume that the primes less than the square root of <em>R</em> are known.  In practice, <em>L</em> and <em>R</em> will be large, maybe 10<sup>16</sup> or 10<sup>18</sup>, and <em>B</em> will be somewhat smaller, maybe 10<sup>8</sup> or 10<sup>10</sup>.</p>
<p>We will explain the algorithm by computing the primes in the range 100 to 200, with <em>B</em> = 10; since we don&#8217;t look at even numbers, the algorithm will make five passes, each time sieving twenty numbers.</p>
<p>There are six primes less than the square root of 200: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13; we will ignore 2, since it is even.  Associated with each prime <em>P<sub>k</sub></em> is a number we will call <em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> that is the offset within <em>B</em> of the first prime in the current sieving block that is divisible by <em>P<sub>k</sub></em>.  For instance, when sieving from 100 to 120, the primes are 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 and the associated <em>Q</em>s are 2, 2, 2, 10, and 8.  Each <em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> can be initialized by computing <em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> = (-1/2 &times; (<em>L</em> + 1 + <em>P<sub>k</sub></em>)) mod <em>P<sub>k</sub></em> and re-initialized for the next 2<em>B</em> block by computing <em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> = (<em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> &#8211; <em>B</em>) mod <em>P<sub>k</sub></em>; for instance, the <em>Q</em>s at the second sieving block from 120 to 140 are 1, 2, 6, 0, and 11.</p>
<p>Within each sieving block, we create an array of booleans (in practice, it is common to use bits) that is initialized to <code>true</code>.  Then each prime is sieved in the normal way starting at the <em>Q<sub>k</sub></em> offset.  In our example, prime 3 with associated <em>Q</em> = 2 causes us to reset bits 2, 5, and 8 to <code>false</code>.  Likewise, prime 5 causes us to reset bits 2 and 7, prime 7 causes us to reset bits 2 and 9, prime 11 has no odd multiples in the current sieving block, and prime 13 causes us to reset bit 8.  After sieving, the bits that are still <code>true</code> are 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6, which correspond to primes 101, 103, 107, 109, and 113.</p>
<p>It is instructive to take five minutes to work out the example sieve by hand.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that performs a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes as described above.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/02/05/segmented-sieve-of-eratosthenes/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/ZQA6ldK8">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
