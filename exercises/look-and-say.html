<div class="entrybody">
<p>The &#8220;Look and Say&#8221; sequence, Sloane number <a href="http://oeis.org/A005150">A005150</a>, begins 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, &hellip;.  Each term is constructed from its predecessor by stating the frequency and number of each group of like digits.  For instance, the term after 1211 is &#8220;one 1, one 2, and two 1s&#8221;, or 111221.  This sequence was studied by the British mathematician John Horton Conway, and has some fascinating properties; see <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LookandSaySequence.html">MathWorld</a> or follow the references at Sloane&#8217;s if you are interested.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program to compute the look and say sequence.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/03/15/look-and-say/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/XC60i6ec">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
