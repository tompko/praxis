<p>In the last several exercises we have been building a library of functions for dealing with big integers.  Our library supports basic predicates and comparisons, the four basic arithmetic operations, and input and output.  Now is a good time to pause, consolidate what we have done, and test it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a test suite for the big number library.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/06/21/big-numbers-testing/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/um9s9k8r">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
