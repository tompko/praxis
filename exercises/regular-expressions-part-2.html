<h2>Regular Expressions, Part&nbsp;2</h2>
<h3>September 18, 2009</h3>
</div>
<div class="entrybody">
<p>In the previous <a href="/2009/09/15/regular-expressions-part-1">exercise</a>, we decided on an intermediate representation for regular expressions and wrote a parser that produces the intermediate representation corresponding to a regular expression given as input.</p>
<p>Your task today is to write the corresponding matcher that takes an intermediate representation and a target string and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the regular expression matches the target string, using the same conventions as the prior <a href="/2009/09/15/regular-expressions-part-1">exercise</a>.  Your matcher will be similar to Rob Pike&#8217;s matcher that we studied <a href="2009/09/11/beautiful-code/">previously</a>.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/09/18/regular-expressions-part-2/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/eUxD9mwZ">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
