<p>Numbers of the form M<sub><em>n</em></sub> = 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>&minus;1 are known as <em>Mersenne numbers</em>, named for the French monk Marin Mersenne who studied them early in the seventeenth century.  Of the infinite set of Mersenne numbers, 47 are currently known to be prime; see Sloane&#8217;s <a href="http://oeis.org/A000043">A000043</a> for a list of their indices.  Mersenne primes can be identified by the Lucas-Lehmer test, devised by &Eacute;douard Lucas in the 1870s and cast into its modern form by Derrick Lehmer in 1930:</p>
<blockquote><p>For <em>p</em> an odd prime, the Mersenne number 2<sup><em>p</em></sup>&minus;1 is prime if and only if 2<sup><em>p</em></sup>&minus;1 divides S<sub><em>p</em>&minus;1</sub> where S<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> = S<sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>2</sup>&minus;2 and S<sub>1</sub> = 4.</p></blockquote>
<p>The special form of Mersenne primes makes them easy to identify, and for many years the largest known prime has been a Mersenne prime.  A cooperative project on the internet, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (<a href="http://www.mersenne.org">GIMPS</a>), has found all of the recent Mersenne primes, because the numbers have grown so large that a single computer can&#8217;t handle the workload.</p>
<p>Your task is to use the Lucas-Lehmer test to find the Mersenne primes through M<sub>256</sub>.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/06/03/mersenne-primes/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/VEUVtatQ">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
