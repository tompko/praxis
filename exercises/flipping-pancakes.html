<p>Pity the poor waiter:</p>
<blockquote><p>The chef in our place is sloppy, and when he prepares a stack of pancakes they come out all different sizes.  Therefore, when I deliver them to a customer, on the way to the table I rearrange them (so that the smallest winds up on top, and so on, down to the largest at the bottom) by grabbing several from the top and flipping them over, repeating this (varying the number I flip) as many times as necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to write a function that sorts a list of unique positive integers into ascending order using the pancake-flipping algorithm.  When you are finished, you can <a href="http://programmingpraxis.wordpress.com/2009/04/07/flipping-pancakes/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/HQFNnbnb">run</a> a suggested solution, or post your solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
