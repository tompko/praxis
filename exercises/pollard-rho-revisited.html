<p>We examined John Pollard&#8217;s rho algorithm for factoring integers in a <a href="/2009/06/19/monte-carlo-factorization/">previous exercise</a>.  In today&#8217;s exercise we will consider some improvements to the basic algorithm.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a quick refresher.  Consider the sequence <em>x</em>x<sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> = (<em>x<sub>n</sub></em>)<sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em> (mod <em>n</em>), which becomes cyclic in approximately &radic;<em>n</em> steps.  If <em>n</em> = <em>p</em> <em>q</em> with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> relatively prime, then there will be a pair of numbers <em>x</em><sub>i</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>j</sub> such that <em>p</em> = gcd(|<em>x</em><sub>i</sub> &#8211; <em>x</em><sub>j</sub>|, <em>n</em>).  The rho algorithm runs the sequence, for random <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>c</em>, looking for the pair of numbers <em>x</em><sub>i</sub> and <em>x</em><sub>j</sub> for which the gcd is between 1 and <em>n</em>, giving a factor of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>If the sequence becomes cyclic without finding a factor, it is necessary to try again with different values of <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>c</em>.  Pollard used Robert Floyd&#8217;s tortoise-and-hare cycle finding algorithm, which compares the values of <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> (the &#8220;tortoise&#8221;) and <em>x</em><sub>2<em>i</em></sub> (the &#8220;hare&#8221;, because it moves twice as fast through the cycle as the tortoise); if they are ever equal, a cycle has been identified.  Later, Richard Brent devised an alternate method of cycle detection.  Each time <em>i</em> is a power of two, the value of <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> is saved; if a subsequent <em>x<sub>j</sub></em> = <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> is found before <em>j</em> = 2<em>i</em>, a cycle has been identified.  Brent&#8217;s cycle-finding algorithm requires only one modular multiplication per step, instead of the three modular multiplications required by Floyd&#8217;s cycle-finding algorithm, so even though Brent&#8217;s method typically requires more steps that Floyd&#8217;s method, in practice the number of modular multiplications is generally about a quarter less than Floyd&#8217;s method, giving a welcome speed-up to Pollard&#8217;s factoring algorithm.</p>
<p>There are two other improvements to Pollard&#8217;s algorithm that apply to both the Floyd and Brent variants.  First, it may be useful to perform trial division to find small divisors before the main algorithm starts; it is certainly necessary to remove factors of 2, and removing larger factors can also save time.  Second, because the gcd required at each step is computationally expensive, the numbers |<em>x<sub>i</sub></em> &#8211; <em>x<sub>j</sub></em>| may be accumulated (multiplied all together) modulo <em>n</em> for several steps, then the gcd of the modular product is taken with <em>n</em>.  If the number of steps between gcd operations is, say, 100, the cost of a gcd at each step is replaced by the cost of a modular multiplication, which is smaller.</p>
<p>Your task is to write two versions of the Pollard rho function, one using Floyd&#8217;s cycle-finding algorithm, the other using Brent&#8217;s cycle-finding algorithm, both versions using trial division to identify small factors and both using the short-circuit gcd procedure, and to compare timings to determine which algorithm, using which parameters for the limit of trial division and the limit of the gcd short-circuit, makes the fastest implementation of Pollard&#8217;s algorithm.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/01/21/pollard-rho-revisited/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/WnqrjcxX">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
