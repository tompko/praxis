<div class="entrybody">
<p>In an election, the winner is required to have the majority of the votes. For instance, with the set of votes {A A A C C B B C C C B C C}, the winner is C with 7 of 13 votes. Some elections have no winner; with the set of votes {A B C A B C A}, A gets a plurality of the votes but not a majority, so there is no winner. You can think of voting as a political election, or as redundant hardware in a critical system where a failure of one component must not lead to failure of the overall system.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that determines the winner of a vote, or indicates that no candidate reached a majority. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/12/16/majority-voting/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/CMspzByH">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
