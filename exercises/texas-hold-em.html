<p>Texas Hold &#8216;Em is a variant of poker.  After the ante, two cards are dealt face down to each player and a round of betting ensues.  Then three community cards (the <em>flop</em>), which may be used by any player, are dealt, followed by another round of betting.  Then a single community card (the <em>turn</em>) is dealt, followed by a round of betting, followed by the final community card (the <em>river</em>) with its round of betting.  In total, each player has two concealed cards plus five community cards, and the player with the best five-card hand of any of the seven cards available to him is the winner, claiming the pot.  Poker hands are ranked, from highest to lowest, according to the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Straight flush: Five cards in sequence, all of the same suit.  The ace can be played either high or low.  Between two straight flushes, the highest-ranking card wins; two straight flushes with the same sequence tie.</li>
<li>Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank, plus one unmatched card.  Highest-ranking quads beat lower-ranking quads; if both are the same, the highest-ranking kicker wins, otherwise there is a tie.</li>
<li>Full house: Three matching cards of one rank, and two matching cards of another.  The hand with the highest-ranking triplet wins; if both are the same, the highest-ranking pair wins, otherwise there is a tie.</li>
<li>Flush: Five cards of the same suit.  Two flushes are compared by the ranks of their cards; the highest-ranking card wins, in the event of a tie the second highest-ranking card wins, and so on until a difference is found.  If both flushes have cards of the same rank, they tie.</li>
<li>Straight: Five cards in sequence.  The ace may be used either high or low.  Two straights are ranked by their highest cards; if their highest cards are equal, they tie.</li>
<li>Three of a kind:  Three cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards.  The highest-ranking triplet wins; if they are the same, the kickers are compared to break the tie.</li>
<li>Two pair: Two cards with matched rank, plus two more cards of matched rank, plus one unmatched card.  Two-pair hands are ranked on the highest pair, then the lowest pair, and finally the kicker.</li>
<li>One pair: Two cards with matched rank, plus three more unmatched cards.  The highest-ranking pair wins, with the three kickers used to break ties.</li>
<li>High card: Five unmatched cards.  Hands are ranked on their highest card, followed by their second-highest card, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your task is to write a program that selects the best five-card hand from a list of seven cards.
