<p>Vedic arithmetic is a system of arithmetic devised in India for pencil-and-paper calculations.  One of the calculations determines if one number is a divisor of another; the divisor must be odd and not divisible by 5; if the divisor is even or divisible by 5, factors of 2 and 5 should be removed before continuing.  The <a href="http://everything2.com/title/Generic+divisibility+test#rep_movsd">calculation</a> is a three-step process:</p>
<p>1) Determine the <em>osculator</em> of the divisor by multiplying it by the smallest number that will make the last digit 9, then strip the last digit 9 and add 1.</p>
<p>2) For each digit in the dividend, strip the last digit, then add that last digit times the osculator to the remaining digits in the dividend, giving a new dividend.  Repeat as long as the dividend keeps decreasing.</p>
<p>3) Finally, divide the remaining dividend by the original divisor.  If the remainder is 0, then the original divisor evenly divides the original dividend; otherwise not.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example.  For a divisor of 23, the number 23 is multiplied by 3, giving 69, then the last digit 9 is stripped, giving 6, and 1 is added, giving 7; thus, the osculator for 23 is 7.  To test if 13174584 is divisible by 23, strip the 4 from the end of 13174584, multiply the stripped 4 times the osculator 7, giving 28, and add 28 to the stripped dividend 1317458 giving 1317486.  Repeat, giving a new dividend of 131748 + 42 = 131790.  Repeat again, giving a new dividend of 13179 (you can always drop a trailing 0, because 0 times the osculator is 0).  Another iteration gives a new dividend of 1317 + 63 = 1380, from which we drop the trailing 0, giving 138.  One final iteration gives 13 + 56 = 69.  Now 69 &divide; 23 = 3, so 23 divides 13174584 and we are finished.</p>
<p>It is obviously easier for a computer to just perform the division and check the remainder; this method is intended for pencil-and-paper calculation (or even mental calculation).</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that implements the Vedic divisibility test.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/07/08/vedic-divisibility/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/qZrg7y54">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
