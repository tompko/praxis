<h2>Validating Telephone&nbsp;Numbers</h2>

<p>When I was a kid, telephones had rotary dials, not push buttons, and exchanges had names; my grandmother was in the Underhill 8 exchange. If you were calling someone in the same exchange as you were, you only had to dial the last four digits of the number. Long distance calling generally involved a human operator.</p>
<p>Modern American telephone numbers have ten digits, segmented as a three-digit area code, a three-digit exchange code, and a four-digit number. Within an area code, you need only dial (the verb hasn&#8217;t changed, even though telephones no longer have a dial) the seven-digit exchange code and number; otherwise, you must dial the complete ten-digit number, often with a prefix.</p>
<p>Our exercise today asks you to validate a telephone number, as if written on an input form. Telephone numbers can be written as ten digits, or with dashes, spaces, or dots between the three segments, or with the area code parenthesized; both the area code and any white space between segments are optional. Thus, all of the following are valid telephone numbers: 1234567890, 123-456-7890, 123.456.7890, (123)456-7890, (123) 456-7890 (note the white space following the area code), and 456-7890. The following are not valid telephone numbers: 123-45-6789, 123:4567890, and 123/456-7890.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a phone number validator that follows the rules given above; your function should either return a valid telephone number or an indication that the input is invalid. Be sure to write a proper test suite. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/12/13/validating-telephone-numbers/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/qqpZYP36">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
