<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law">Benford&#8217;s Law</a>, which was discovered by Simon Newcomb in 1881 and rediscovered by Frank Benford in 1938, states that, for many sets of numbers that arise in a scale-invariant manner, the first digit is distributed logarithmically, with the first digit 1 about 30% of the time, decreasing digit by digit until the first digit is 9 about 5% of the time.  Stated mathematically, the leading digit <em>d</em> &isin; {1 &hellip; <em>b</em>-1} for a number written in base <em>b</em> will occur with probability <em>P<sub>d</sub></em> = log<sub><em>b</em></sub>(1 + <sup>1</sup>/<sub><em>d</em></sub>).  Thus, in base 10, the probabilities of the first digit being the number 1, 2, &hellip; 9 are 30.1%, 17.6%, 12.5%, 9.7%, 7.9%, 6.7%, 5.8%, 5.1% and 4.6%.</p>
<p><a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BenfordsLaw.html">Benford&#8217;s Law</a> is counter-intuitive but arises frequently in nature.  It is also frequently <a href="http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/1999/May/nigrini">used in auditing</a>.  Make a list of the amounts of the checks that a bookkeeper has written in the past year; if more that 5% begin with the digit 8 or 9, the bookkeeper is likely an embezzler.  More important, precinct results of the disputed Iranian elections a year ago displayed anomalous first-digit counts, <a onclick="return mugicPopWin(this,event);" oncontextmenu="mugicRightClick(this);" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/statistical-sleuthing-on-the-iran-election-747/">suggesting vote fraud</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, Shriram Krishnamurthy issued a <a href="http://lists.racket-lang.org/users/archive/2010-October/042220.html">programming challenge</a> on the Racket mailing list, asking for smallest/tightest/cleanest/best code to calculate the first-digit percentages of a list of numbers; he also challenged readers to apply the function to data in a comma-separated values file.  He didn&#8217;t give a source, but did mention that he was interested in the littoral area (in acres) of the lakes of Missesota; sample data appears on the <a href="/2010/10/26/benfords-law/2/">next page</a>.</p>
<p>Your first task is to write a function that calculates the first-digit percentages of a list of numbers.  Your second task is to calculate the first-digit percentages of the data on the next page.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/10/26/benfords-law/3/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/7l3dRSAn">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
