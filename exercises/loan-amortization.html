<div class="entrybody">
<p>My daughter, a freshman in high school, is just completing her first programming class, using Java.  Her final assignment was to write a program to print a loan amortization table, given an initial balance, annual interest rate, term in months, and monthly payment.</p>
<p>Your task is to write that program (you are not restricted to Java), then print the amortization table for a three-year car loan of $10,000 at 7% (it&#8217;s an old textbook).  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/05/12/loan-amortization/2/">read</a> a suggested solution, or to post your solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
