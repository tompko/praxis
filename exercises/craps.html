<p>Craps is a gambling game played with two dice. The &#8220;shooter&#8221; begins the game by rolling two dice. If the pips on the dice total 2, 3 or 12, the shooter loses. If the pips on the dice total 7 or 11, the shooter wins. If the pips on the dice total 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, the total of the pips establishes the &#8220;point&#8221; and shooter continues to roll until he rolls the point, when he wins, or he rolls a 7, when he loses.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that simulates a game of craps. Use the program to calculate various statistics: What is the most common roll? What is the average winning percentage? What is the average number of rolls in a game? The maximum? Or you can make your own questions. When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2011/11/04/craps/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/J9Tg9jZP">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
