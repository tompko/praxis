<div class="entrybody">
<p>Long ago, Carl Hewitt created the <em>same-fringe</em> problem as a demonstration of the simplest problem that requires concurrency to implement efficiently: Given two binary trees, determine if they have the same leaves in the same order, regardless of their internal structure.  A solution that simply flattens both trees into lists and compares them element-by-element is unacceptable, as it requires space to store the intermediate lists and time to compute them even if a difference arises early in the computation.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that tests if two trees have the same fringe.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/08/03/carl-hewitts-same-fringe-problem/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/ZNuaLYqQ">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
