<div class="entrybody">
<p>The weather forecast in the daily newspaper publishes the times of sunrise and sunset, a calculation that we examined in a previous <a href="/2009/11/24/sunrise-sunset/">exercise</a>.  The daily newspaper also publishes the phase of the moon, a calculation that we examine in today&#8217;s exercise.</p>
<p>The moon circles the earth every 29.530588853 days, so pick a starting point and count.  A new moon occurred at julian date 2451550.1 (January 6, 2000).  Then it is easy to count the number of days since the last new moon.</p>
<p>There are eight generally recognized phases of the moon: new, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, last quarter, and waning crescent.  To calculate the phase of the moon simply divide the days since the last new moon by eight and select the appropriate phase.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that calculates the phase of the moon for a given date.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/01/22/phases-of-the-moon/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/23rZcxsl">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
