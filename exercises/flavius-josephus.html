<p>Flavius Josephus was a famous Jewish historian of the first century, at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple.  According to legend, during the Jewish-Roman war he was trapped in a cave with a group of forty soldiers surrounded by Romans.  Preferring death to capture, the Jews decided to form a circle and, proceeding around it, to kill every third person remaining until no one was left.  Josephus found the safe spot in the circle and thus stayed alive.</p>
