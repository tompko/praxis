<p>These three problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad recently <a href="http://elrinconde-ex.blogspot.com/2009/07/solving-simple-international.html">popped up</a> on the web.</p>
<p>IMO 1960 Problem 01</p>
<blockquote><p>Determine all three-digit numbers N having the property that N is divisible by 11, and N/11 is equal to the sum of the squares of the digits of N.</p></blockquote>
<p>IMO 1962 Problem 01</p>
<blockquote><p>Find the smallest natural number n which has the following properties:</p>
<p>(a) Its decimal representation has 6 as the last digit.<br />
(b) If the last digit 6 is erased and placed in front of the remaining digits, the resulting number is four times as large as the original number n.</p></blockquote>
<p>IMO 1963 Problem 06</p>
<blockquote><p>Five students, A,B,C,D,E, took part in a contest. One prediction was that the contestants would finish in the order ABCDE. This prediction was very poor. In fact no contestant finished in the position predicted, and no two contestants predicted to finish  consecutively actually did so. A second prediction had the contestants finishing in the order DAECB. This prediction was  better. Exactly two of the contestants finished in the places predicted, and two disjoint pairs of students predicted to finish consecutively actually did so. Determine the order in which the contestants finished.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to solve the three problems.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/07/17/international-mathematical-olympiad/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/JRGmt2wZ">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
