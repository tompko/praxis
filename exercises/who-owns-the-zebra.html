<h2>Who Owns The&nbsp;Zebra?</h2>

<div class="entrybody">
<p>This famous puzzle was first published by <em>Life</em> magazine on December 17, 1962.  It has been variously attributed to both Albert Einstein and Lewis Carroll, but the true author is not known.  There are several versions; this is the original from <em>Life</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1  There are five houses.</p>
<p>2  The Englishman lives in the red house.</p>
<p>3  The Spaniard owns the dog.</p>
<p>4  Coffee is drunk in the green house.</p>
<p>5  The Ukrainian drinks tea.</p>
<p>6  The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.</p>
<p>7  The Old Gold smoker owns snails.</p>
<p>8  Kools are smoked in the yellow house.</p>
<p>9  Milk is drunk in the middle house.</p>
<p>10 The Norwegian lives in the first house.</p>
<p>11 The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.</p>
<p>12 Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.</p>
<p>13 The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.</p>
<p>14 The Japanese smokes Parliaments.</p>
<p>15 The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.</p>
<p>In the interest of clarity, it must be added that each of the five houses is painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and smoke different brands of American cigarettes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to write a program to solve the puzzle and determine:  Who drinks water?  Who owns the zebra?  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/06/16/who-owns-the-zebra/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/408Ehwhb">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
