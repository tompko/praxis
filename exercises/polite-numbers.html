<p>A number is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polite_number"><em>polite</em></a> if it can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers; for instance, 7 is polite because it can be written at 3 + 4.  Some numbers can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers in more than one way; for instance, 15 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 7 + 8.  The number of ways that a number can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers is its <em>politeness</em>.  Any number that is a power of 2 cannot be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers; such a number has a politeness of 0, and is thus <em>impolite</em>.</p>
<p>There is a set of consecutive integers that sum to a given number for each odd divisor of the number greater than 1.  For instance, the divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.  The only odd divisor of 28 greater than 1 is 7, so 28 has a politeness of 1.  The set of consecutive integers has length 7 (the divisor) and is centered at 4 = 28 &divide; 7: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7; that works because there are 7 numbers with an average of 4 (since they are centered on 4).  In some cases, such as the divisor 11 of the number 33, the set of numbers includes negative integers: -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8; in that case, the negative integers cancel out the corresponding positive integers, so the remaining set is 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 33.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that calculates all the ways that a number can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive numbers.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/12/17/polite-numbers/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/YgFEcg8Q">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
