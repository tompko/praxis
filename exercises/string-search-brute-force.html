<p>In this exercise, and several that will follow, we will examine algorithms for searching a string.  Our goal is to write a function that takes a pattern and a string and either returns the index of the first location of the pattern or an indication that the pattern is not present in the string; an optional third argument allows the search to start at an arbitrary point in the string.  Our pattern is simply a fixed string; unlike regular expressions, there are no meta-characters.</p>
<p>Our first string-search algorithm uses brute force: place the pattern at each possible location in the search string and compare character-by-character to determine if there is a match.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that performs brute-force string searching as described above. Since we will be writing several other string searching functions, you should also write a test suite that will find any errors in your function.  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2009/08/21/string-search-brute-force/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/XanMzASO">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
