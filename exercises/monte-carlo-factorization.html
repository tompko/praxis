<p>We have previously examined two methods of integer factorization, trial division using <a href="/2009/05/08/wheel-factorization/">wheels</a> and Fermat&#8217;s <a href="/2009/05/19/fermats-method/">method</a> of the differences of squares.  In this exercise we examine a probabilistic method of integer factorization that takes only a small, fixed amount of memory and tends to be very fast.  This method was developed by John Pollard in 1975 and is commonly called the Pollard rho algorithm.</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on the observation that, for any two random integers <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that are congruent modulo <em>p</em>, the greatest common divisor of their difference and <em>n</em>, the integer being factored, will be 1 if <em>p</em> and <em>n</em> are coprime (have no factors in common) but will be between 1 and <em>n</em> if <em>p</em> is a factor of <em>n</em>.  By the birthday paradox, <em>p</em> will be found with reasonably large probability after trying about <img src="http://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=555555&amp;s=0" alt="\sqrt{p}" title="\sqrt{p}" class="latex" /> random pairs.</p>
<p>Pollard&#8217;s algorithm uses a function modulo <em>n</em> to generate a pseudo-random sequence.  Two copies of the sequence are run, one twice as fast as the other, and their values are saved as <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.  At each step, we calculate <em>gcd</em>(<em>x</em>-<em>y</em>,<em>n</em>).  If the greatest common divisor is one, we loop, since the two values are coprime.  If the greatest common divisor is <em>n</em>, then the values of the two sequences have become equal and Pollard&#8217;s algorithm fails, since the sequences have fallen into a cycle, which is detected by Floyd&#8217;s tortoise-and-hare cycle-finding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_cycle-finding_algorithm">algorithm</a>; that&#8217;s why we have two copies of the sequence, one (the &#8220;hare&#8221;) running twice as fast as the other (the &#8220;tortoise&#8221;).  But if the greatest common divisor is between 1 and <em>n</em>, we have found a factor of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Failure doesn&#8217;t mean failure.  It just means that the particular pseudo-random sequence that we chose doesn&#8217;t lead to success.  Our response to failure is to try another sequence.  We use the function <em>x</em>Â² + <em>c</em> (mod <em>n</em>), where <em>c</em> is initially 1.  If Pollard&#8217;s algorithm fails, we increase <em>c</em> to 2, then 3, and so on.  If we keep increasing <em>c</em>, we will eventually find a factor, though it may take a long time if <em>n</em> is large.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement Pollard&#8217;s factorization algorithm.  You can test it by calculating the factors of the 98th Mersenne number, 2<sup>98</sup> &#8211; 1.
