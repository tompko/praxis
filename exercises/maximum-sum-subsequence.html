<p>We&#8217;ll categorize today&#8217;s exercise as part of our on-going series of interview questions, but it&#8217;s really more than that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Given a sequence of integers, both positive and negative, find the contiguous subsequence with the maximum sum.  For instance, given the sequence 31, -41, 59, 26, -53, 58, 97, -93, -23, 84, the maximum sum subsequence is 59, 26, -53, 58, 97, which sums to 187.</p></blockquote>
<p>Your task is to write a series of functions that takes a sequence (use either a list or an array, whichever is convenient for your programming language) and returns the sum of the maximum sum subsequence; you should find solutions with time complexities of <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>3</sup>),  <em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>),  <em>O</em>(<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>), and  <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>).  When you are finished, you are welcome to <a href="/2010/12/03/maximum-sum-subsequence/2/">read</a> or <a href="http://programmingpraxis.codepad.org/eM3jPDSO">run</a> a suggested solution, or to post your own solution or discuss the exercise in the comments below.</p>
