<p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes <a href="/2009/02/19/sieve-of-eratosthenes/">computes</a> all primes less than some given <em>n</em>. But sometimes you need the opposite, the first <em>n</em> primes, not knowing the largest prime in the set. One method is to calculate the <em>n</em>th prime, using a <a href="http://programmingpraxis.com/2011/08/02/the-nth-prime/">prime-counting formula</a>, then use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate the list. Or instead of calculating the <em>n</em>th prime directly, you can over-estimate the <em>n</em>th prime using the formula <em>P<sub>n</sub></em> &lt; <em>n</em> log (<em>n</em> log <em>n</em>), then trim the list as needed; that&#8217;s the natural logarithm to the base <em>e</em>.</p>
<p>Another method is described by Melissa O&#8217;Neill in her <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/papers/Sieve-JFP.pdf">article</a> <em>The Genuine Sieve of Eratosthenes</em>. Her method is based on sifting each prime, and makes exactly the same sequence of calculations as the regular Sieve of Eratosthenes, but instead of marking bits in a bitarray it uses a priority queue to keep track of composites, one item in the priority queue for each prime; thus, instead of marking all the composite multiples of each sifting prime all at once, in the bitarray, O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s method keeps a priority queue of the next item in each sifting sequence, inserts a new sifting sequence in the priority queue as each new prime is encountered, and resets the next item in each sifting sequence as it is reached.</p>
<p>Thus, ignoring 2 and the even numbers, O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s method begins with <em>i</em> = 3 and an empty priority queue. Since 3 is not in the priority queue, it is prime, so it is output, the pair <em>i</em>&times;<em>i</em>/<em>i</em>&times;2 = 9/6 is added to the queue, and <em>i</em> is advanced to <em>i</em> + 2 = 5. Now since 5 is not in the queue, it is prime, so it is output, the pair 25/10 is added to the queue, and <em>i</em> is advanced to 7. Now since 7 is not in the queue, it is prime, so it is output, the pair 49/14 is added to the queue, and <em>i</em> is advanced to 9; at this point the queue is [9/6 25/10 49/7]. Now <em>i</em> = 9 <em>is</em> in the queue, so it is composite, and the pair 9/6 is removed from the priority queue and replaced by the pair 15/6, where 15 is calculated as the current composite 9 plus the skip value 6. And so on, until the desired number of primes has been generated. Note that in some cases a composite will be a member of multiple sifting sequences, and each must be replaced; for instance, when <em>i</em> reaches 45, it is a member of the sifting sequences for both 3 and 5, so the priority queue will have pairs 45/6 and 45/10, which should be replaced by 51/6 and 55/10, respectively.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s algorithm to compute the first <em>n</em> primes.
